This file contains instructions and best practices for Gemini to follow when working on this project.

## Lovable Site Generation

Lovable is an AI-powered platform for creating full-stack websites and applications through a chat-based interface. Here's how it works:

### Core Functionality

*   **Chat-Based Development:** Build by describing your needs in a conversation with the AI.
*   **AI-Powered Code Generation:** The AI generates both frontend and backend code.
*   **Full-Stack Engineering:** The platform acts as an AI full-stack product engineer, creating the UI and backend functionality.

### Key Features

*   **Ease of Use:** Designed for all skill levels, including non-coders.
*   **Customization and Editing:** "Dev Mode" allows for direct code editing.
*   **Backend and Database Integration:** Supports database integration (e.g., Supabase).
*   **GitHub Integration:** Sync projects with a GitHub account.
*   **Design:** Aims to create beautifully designed websites following UI & UX best practices.
*   **Deployment:** Offers one-click deployment and custom domain support.

## Best UX Practices for Web Solutions

### Core Principles of User-Centric Design

*   **User-Centricity and Personalization:** Place the user at the center of the design process.
*   **Simplicity and Minimalist Design:** Avoid clutter and unnecessary elements.
*   **Consistency and Standards:** Maintain consistency in design elements.

### Usability and Navigation

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear, consistent, and predictable navigation.
*   **Visibility of System Status:** Keep users informed about what is happening.
*   **User Control and Freedom:** Users should feel in control and have the freedom to undo actions.
*   **Recognition Over Recall:** Minimize the user's memory load.

### Performance and Accessibility

*   **Speed and Performance:** Optimize for fast loading times.
*   **Mobile-First and Responsive Design:** Design for smaller screens first.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities (WCAG).

### Content and Engagement

*   **Compelling and Scannable Content:** Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet points.
*   **Engaging Visuals:** Use high-quality images, videos, and infographics.
*   **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** Guide users toward a specific goal.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Increase user engagement with interactive elements.

### Feedback and Improvement

*   **Data-Driven Design:** Use analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions.
*   **Error Prevention and Handling:** Design interfaces that prevent errors and handle them gracefully.
*   **Help and Documentation:** Provide help when needed.
